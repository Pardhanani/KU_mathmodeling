### Math modeling lab modules (work in progress, as of June 2025)

This is a collection of hands on, self-guided lab modules designed to introduce 
mathematical and statistical modeling in the context of a variety of real-world 
application areas.  The starting point, or homepage, of this project is 
<A HREF="./KU_mathmodeling.ipynb">KU_mathmodeling.ipynb</A>.  Our target audience 
is undergraduate students in any discipline, who have an interest in 
creative solutions to everyday issues, a bit of intellectual curiosity, and 
a bit of background in college-level math.

We are particularly interested in attracting teachers of applied mathematics, STEM, or 
other relevant courses to use these materials in their classroom.  There are at least 2 
reasons why a teacher might find this helpful: (1) these labs provide a quick and easy way to 
enhance existing course materials with real world problems; and (2) we encourage teachers to 
edit, modifiy, extend or adapt these materials in any way they wish, so that it best fits 
their goals.  Another potential use of these materials is to help students prepare for math 
modeling contests.

We emphasize, these materials DO NOT provide much of a mathematical exposition of 
the modeling methods used.  Instead, the focus is primarily on applying the methods 
in context, and in gaining insights about the quality and reliability of the 
models.  Thus, the materials are unlikely to be a good fit for mathematically-oriented 
modeling courses or students.

Each lab module consists of a single, self-contained Python notebook that 
integrates discussion, graphics, mathematics, and code.  We provide access 
to each notebook in two forms: (1) a static, view only, form, and (2) an interactive 
form, in which the user can run the code segments, as well as make modifications 
and carry out further explorations discussed in the notebook.  Both forms access 
the same underlying notebook -- only the user interface is different.

Our interactive notebooks run on <A HREF="https://mybinder.org/" TARGET="_blank">Binder.org</A>, 
which offers an easy, single-click, login-free way to use its jupyter 
servers.  However, we would like to alert the reader that launching a notebook typically takes a few minutes of startup time, as Binder must first set 
up and install 
the packages and libraries required.  After that, once the notebook opens, 
everything operates like a typical interactive session, with no further 
time-lags or delays.
