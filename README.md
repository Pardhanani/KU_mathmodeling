### Math modeling lab modules (work in progress, as of March 2024)

This is a collection of hands on, self-guided lab modules designed to introduce 
mathematical modeling methods in the context of a variety of real-world application 
areas.  The starting point, or homepage, of this project is 
<A HREF="./KU_mathmodeling.ipynb">KU_mathmodeling.ipynb</A>.  
Our target audience is undergraduate students in any discipline, who have an interest in 
creative solutions to everyday issues, a bit of intellectual curiosity, and 
a bit of background in college-level math.

We emphasize, these materials DO NOT provide much of a mathematical exposition of 
the modeling methods used.  Instead, the focus is primarily on applying the methods 
in context, and in gaining insights about the quality and reliability of our 
models.  Thus, the materials are unlikely to be a good fit for mathematically-oriented 
modeling courses or students.

Each lab module consists of a single, self-contained Python notebook that 
integrates discussion, graphics, mathematics, and code.  We provide access 
to each notebook in two forms: (1) a static, view only, form, and (2) an interactive 
form, in which the user can run the code segments, as well as make modifications 
and carry out further explorations discussed in the notebook.  Both forms access 
the same underlying notebook -- only the user interface is different.

Our interactive notebooks run on <A HREF="https://mybinder.org/">Binder.org</A>, 
which offers an easy, single-click, login-free way to use its jupyter 
servers.  However, we would like to alert the reader that launching a notebook typically takes a few minutes of startup time, as Binder must first set 
up and install 
the packages and libraries required.  After that, once the notebook opens, 
everything operates like a typical interactive session, with no further 
time-lags or delays.
