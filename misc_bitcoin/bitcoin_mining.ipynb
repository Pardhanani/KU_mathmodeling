    "relevant to mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the protocol, Bitcoins are created through an \n",
    "algorithmic process known as \"mining.\"  In Bitcoin terminology \n",
    "the formal name of the mining process is **Proof of Work**.  New \n",
    "Bitcoins come into existence when an individual or entity \n",
    "successfully solves a puzzle-like problem and verifies it \n",
    "through the Bitcoin network.  The winner gets the new Bitcoins \n",
    "as reward. Before we get into details, here are a couple of \n",

This is in stark contrast to regular, old-fashioned currencies, which governments can print at will. </li>\n",
    "        <li>As of mid-2025, about 19.8 million Bitcoins had already been mined, leaving only 1.2 million yet to be mined. However, the Bitcoin protocol/software automatically makes the mining process progressively harder, and it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will not be mined until around the year 2140.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand the Bitcoin mining process, we will first \n",
    "introduce the notion of **blockchain**.  Bitcoin transactions are \n",
    "recorded in the form of small batches called **blocks**.  These \n",
    "blocks are linked to one another through a validation mechanism \n",

    "\n",
    "The real story behind Bitcoin mining is a bit more complicated \n",
    "than the simplified version we've seen so far.  Why?  Consider, \n",
    "for instance, the problem of finding a hash that starts with 10 \n",
    "leading zeros.  According to our probability model in section 3 \n",
    "above, this will require $(16)^{10} \\approx 10^{12}$ attempts, on \n",
    "average.  But, the number of nonce values available for \n",
    "trial and error attempts \n",
    "is only $2^{32}-1 \\approx 4.3\\times 10^6$.  Thus, there is almost \n",
    "no chance of finding this hash by\n",
    "varying the nonce value alone.  In practice, once the nonce range \n",
    "is exhausted, miners vary certain other details in the block \n",
    "header, and repeat the trial and error search process through the \n",
    "entire range of nonce values once again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural (and important) question that arises here is: <br/>\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:#430600\"><b>How do we know there even exists a feasible solution to this problem? In other words, is there a guarantee that a hash with 10 leading zeros can be found via some combination of nonce value and block header data?</b></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, let us take a closer \n",
    "look at the hash function.  Let $f:A \\rightarrow B$ denote \n",
    "the SHA-256 hash function, with \n",
    "$A$ and $B$ respectively representing its domain and range \n",
    "sets.  Here are some questions to carefully reflect on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What elements do $A$ and $B$ contain?  In other words, what types of entities comprise the membership of these sets?\n",
    "2. What is the size (or, cardinality) of sets $A$ and $B$? Are they finite?\n",
    "3. Given those cardinalities, what can you tell about $f$: Can it be one-to-one?  Onto?\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let us treat the outputs from $f$ to be \n",
    "64-digit hexadecimal numbers.  (This makes sense because the \n",
    "set of all 256-bit binary numbers is isomorphic to the set \n",
    "of all 64-digit hexadecimal numbers.)  With that in mind, \n",
    "it is easier to first look at set $B$:  \"Who\" are its \n",
    "members? Hint: All possible outputs of $f$. The answer can \n",
    "be expressed in various equivalent ways\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "  B & = & \\{X: X ~~\\mbox{is a 64-digit hexadecimal number} \\}  \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "   & = & \\{\\mbox{0, 1, 2,} \\ldots, \\mbox{f}\\}^{64} ~~~~~~~ \n",
    "     \\mbox{(in Cartesian product form)}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $B$ is a **finite set**, even though its cardinality of \n",
    "$16^{64}$ is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about $A$?  In the case of Bitcoin mining, the inputs \n",
    "to $f$ consist of \n",
    "data in Bitcoin blocks, which include characters, numbers, \n",
    "the nonce, etc.  However, the SHA-256 function is capable of \n",
    "taking a much broader set of inputs than just Bitcoin \n",
    "blocks.  Mathematically, any finite-length binary string would \n",
    "be a valid input to SHA-256.  Thus, the elements of $A$ can be \n",
    "represented in the from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ where $n$ is a natural \n",
    "number.  Set $A$ is a collection of all such elements, namely \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  A = \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\{0, 1\\}^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies $A$ is **not** a finite set.  It is countably \n",
    "infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the hash function $f$ has a countably infinite domain, \n",
    "and a finite range.  Therefore, it cannot possibly be \n",
    "one-to-one.  What are the implications of this for Bitcoin \n",
    "mining:\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Clearly, set $B$ (the range) contains many, many hexadecimal numbers that start with 10 leading zeros -- or, for that matter, even with 50 leading zeros.  Can you see why?</li>\n",
    "    <li>We assume every 64-digit hexadecimal number is in the range of $f$, which means $f$ is onto $B$.\n",
    "    <li>Since $f$ is <b>not</b> one-to-one, it is possible (and likely) that each element of $B$, even if it starts with 10 or more leading zeros, is the image of many elements of $A$.</li>\n",
