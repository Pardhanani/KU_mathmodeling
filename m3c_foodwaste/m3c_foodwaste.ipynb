    "of people are on the brink of starvation and/or malnutrition due \n",
    "to lack of access to food.  This paradoxical situation is caused \n",
    "by several intertwining factors, one of which is the enormous \n",
    "scale of wasted food in the world.  In a 2011 report, the Food and \n",
    "Agriculture Organization of the UN states that \"roughly one-third \n",

    "[Based on selected winning papers (https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/archives/2018-year-at-a-glance/2018-winning-solutions/)\n",
    "\n",

    "development: clearly define the problem; state any assumptions \n",
    "made; identify the variables used;  construct the math model; \n",
    "analyze and assess the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our problem may be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to create a model to determine whether the amount of food wasted in any given state in the U.S. can be used to feed its food-insecure population.  The state of Texas will be used as example to demonstrate how the model works.\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "2. We also want to construct a model to determine the amount of food wasted per year by a household in the U.S. based on the traits and habits of its members.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategy and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, it is interesting to note that the winning \n",
    "teams arrived at completely different conclusions about Texas -- \n",
    "one team concluded the amount of wasted food is **not** \n",
    "sufficient to feed its food-insecure population, while another \n",
    "team concluded the opposite!  Yet, both teams were \"right\" and \n",
    "won prizes!  How can that happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "A closer examination of the modeling strategy of these two teams \n",
    "reveals there were significant differences in the assumptions they \n",
    "made.  For example, food waste occurs at many different levels: \n",
    "individual households; supermarkets; cafes & restaurants; in \n",
    "warehouses; during transportation; in agriculture & harvesting, \n",
    "etc.  There are no clear guidelines on which type of food waste \n",
    "can be reused to feed people in need.  Teams \n",
    "made varying (but reasonable) assumptions on such questions, \n",
    "resulting in conclusions that were sometimes widely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall approach consists of estimating the \n",
    "amount (or dollar value) of food wasted in the state/province \n",
    "in one year, \n",
    "and comparing it with the amount of food needed to feed its \n",
    "food-insecure population for that year.  The estimate of food waste \n",
    "tends to differ significantly based on the assumptions \n",
    "made.  We will formulate a metric for food waste similar to that \n",
    "developed by Teams \\#10494 and \\#10917. The strategy involves \n",
    "making the following key assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All food wasted at any point in the production to consumption process will be considered usable for feeding the food-insecure.\n",
    " 2. All wasted food can be transported and distributed to those in need without further waste, loss or damage.\n",
    " 3. The dollar value of a food item is a reasonable proxy for the amount and/or quantity and/or calories of that item.\n",
    " 4. All food-insecure individuals have the same food needs every day, and for the entire year.  Thus, we treat the food needs of children and adults the same.\n",
    " 5. A state's cash receipts are a reasonable representation of all food purchased for consumption in that state.\n",
    " 6. Average food waste percentages across North America are representative of the actual food waste in any specific state in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of these assumptions may be hard to justify in a rigorous \n",
    "way (e.g., 1, 2 and 4), they offer a reasonable starting point for \n",
    "a process of iterative model development.  Thus, we will use them \n",
    "to build a first model.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### 3. The model and its variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine whether there is enough food waste in a state to \n",
    "fulfill the needs of the food-insecure, we will formulate separate \n",
    "metrics for the annual waste and the annual needs, in units of US dollars ($W$ and $N$, \n",
    "respectively).  Then, we can define the net surplus as: $S = W-N$.  If \n",
    "$S$ is positive, then the food waste is sufficient to meet the \n",
    "needs of the food-insecure.  If $S$ is negative, then there is a \n",
    "deficit, which would mean the food waste is not sufficient \n",
    "for meeting the needs.  For practical implementation, we will make \n",
    "the following additional refinements, which are based on how the \n",
    "food data are sourced and organized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All food items will be classified into one of 5 categories: Protein, produce (fruits, vegetables, etc), grain, dairy, oil.\n",
    "- Wasted food will be divided into two groups: Production waste, and consumption waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Venn diagram\" style sketch below is helpful for conceptualizing \n",
    "the processes we will consider in our model.  The outermost \n",
    "region (light blue) represents the totality of food produced, \n",
    "including food wasted in production.  The inner grey region \n",
    "is the subset of food purchased for consumption, which is assumed \n",
    "to correspond to the cash receipts.  The innermost subset shown \n",
    "in white represents the food that is actually consumed.  In other \n",
    "words, everything outside the white region is wasted food, either \n",
    "in the production/distribution stage, or in the consumption \n",
    "stage.  Recall, these are all in units of US dollars.\n",
