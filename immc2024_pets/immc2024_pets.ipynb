    "types of households are suitable for adopting cats as pets?  The specific \n",
    "modeling tasks of interest are described in the following excerpts \n",
    "from the 2024 IMMC problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#036610\">\n",
    "> The International Mission for the Maintenance and Care of Animals (IMMC-A), an organization concerned with the well-being of all potential pets, is asking your team to help them develop a quantitatively focused approach to pet ownership that benefits both animals and humans. More specifically, the IMMC-A needs your assistance in building mathematical models to determine which households are prepared to own a pet, how many households are pet-ready, and to forecast future pet ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Warm up (with cats). Develop a mathematical model that can be utilized by an animal shelter, pet store, or similar entity to evaluate a household’s readiness for cat ownership. In other words, your model needs to be able to receive information from a given household and determine if the household is prepared to own a cat. [Please note that the IMMC-A values user-friendly models. Thus, to promote utilization, your model cannot require more than ten input factors from a household. Justification of your team’s choices will play an important role in your model’s viability. Additionally, you should create a diagram that clearly explains your model’s decision-making process.]  \n",
    ">a. What does a cat-ready household ‘look like’? Validate your model’s ability to capture the diversity of households that could have a cat as a pet. Provide at least three examples of households that qualify for cat ownership in a country/region of your choosing and at least three that do not qualify. Be sure to choose examples that highlight the factors, or combination of factors, that your model associates most readily with households that qualify for cat ownership.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We will follow best practices guidelines in model \n",
    "development and address each of the following components: clearly \n",
    "define the problem; state any assumptions \n",
    "made; identify the variables used;  construct the math model; \n",
    "analyze and assess the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our problem may be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - We want to construct a model to determine the readiness of any given household to own a cat as a pet.  \n",
    "> - We want to demonstrate the model's validity by applying it to a variety of households within a region, some that are ready for cat ownership and others that are not.  \n",
    "> - We will also assess the model's broader validity across a few different countries or regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategy and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of our model as a \"black box,\" its essential purpose is \n",
    "to receive a bunch of inputs from the household under \n",
    "consideration and produce an output that indicates whether the \n",
    "household is ready for cat ownership.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach for developing this type of model would be using a \n",
    "data driven strategy.  This would require finding or compiling data on \n",
    "a representative sample of households in the region whose suitability \n",
    "for cat ownership is known from their history.  This dataset can then be \n",
    "used to fit a statistical model, for example, using logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will follow a different strategy here, based on the \n",
    "approach used by \n",
    "[student teams whose solutions the IMMC has made available online](https://immchallenge.org/Contests/2024/Solutions.html).  In \n",
    "this approach, a simple linear algebraic model is constructed \n",
    "based on heuristic interpretation of trends and patterns seen in \n",
    "published data.  Here is an overview of the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. identify a few features (no more than 10) that would make a household either suitable, or unsuitable, for cat ownership.  Each feature will be considered a variable that can be measured or quantified in some form.\n",
    "2. Determine, or assign, reasonable numerical values to each variable.\n",
    "3. Multiply each variable by a weight coefficient, whose value we will determine later.\n",
    "4. Define a household's \"cat suitability\" score as the linear sum of all the weighted variables.  If this score is above a pre-defined threshold, the household will be considered suitable for cat ownership.  Otherwise, it will be considered unsuitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of assumptions are involved in building a model of this \n",
    "type, starting from basic issues such as how to define a \"household\" \n",
    "or \"cat ownership,\" to the selection of household attributes \n",
    "that support (or not) cat ownership, to the relative importance \n",
    "we assign to one attribute over another.  Thus, it would be more \n",
    "effective to discuss the assumptions side by side with model development, \n",
    "which we do in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 3. The model and its variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important aspect of developing this model is what \n",
    "variables (or characteristics) we choose to measure a \n",
    "household's readiness for cat ownership.  Like many real-world \n",
    "modeling problems, this requires a combination of both scientific \n",
    "thinking and creative thinking.  Another important aspect is the \n",
    "quantitative scale used for each variable, and how we select its \n",
    "weight coefficient in the linear combination that makes up the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the ideas and assumptions presented in the \n",
    "[student papers](https://immchallenge.org/Contests/2024/Solutions.html), \n",
    "we use the following variables to measure household readiness:\n",
    "<ol type=\"a\">\n",
    "  <li><b>Adequate space</b>: For the health and comfort of a cat, the \n",
    "      household must provide sufficient physical space in which the \n",
    "      animal can move, play and explore. Although indoor spaces are \n",
    "      considered safer, protected or enclosed outdoor spaces would also \n",
    "      be acceptable.  The symbol $X_s$ will be used to denote the space \n",
    "      variable, and its units will be taken as \n",
    "      square meters.\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Time availability</b>: In spite of their perceived \n",
    "        independence, it is well-established that domestic cats \n",
    "        require some regular attention and companionship, in order \n",
    "        to survive and thrive.  Thus, we will take the owner's time \n",
    "        availability as a variable to measure household readiness.  The  \n",
    "        symbol $X_t$ will be used to denote the average number of \n",
    "        hours per day an owner can spend with their cat.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Financial resources</b>: Maintaining the health and \n",
    "        well-being of a cat requires spending money on adequate and \n",
    "        appropriate food, veterinary care, cat litter, and possibly \n",
    "        also things such as grooming, toys, treats, scratching posts, \n",
    "        etc.  The symbol $X_f$ will be used to denote the household's \n",
    "        income in U.S. dollars.\n",

    "        cat ownership.  Examples include the number and proximity of vet \n",
    "        clinics, and stores where cat food and supplies are \n",

    "        decreases).\n",
    "    </li>\n",

    "        a household that has previously owned a cat, or even another \n",
    "        type of pet, would be more realistic in understanding the \n",
    "        responsibilities of cat ownership.  For simplicity, we treat \n",
    "        this as a binary variable, whose value is either 1 (if the \n",
    "        household does have previous experience), or 0 (otherwise).  It \n",
    "        will be denoted $X_e$.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Allergy</b>: Some people are known to be allergic to \n",

    "        household would not be a good fit for cat ownership if any of \n",
    "        its members is allergic to cats.  We incorporate this into a binary \n",
