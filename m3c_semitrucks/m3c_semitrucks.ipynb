    "[Based on selected winning papers (https://m3challenge.siam.org/resources/archives/2020-year-at-a-glance/2020-winning-solutions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of best practices, the M3 Challenge Contest recommends \n",
    "addressing each of the following components in the course of model \n",
    "development: clearly define the problem; state any assumptions \n",
    "made; identify the variables used;  construct the math model; \n",
    "analyze and assess the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our problem may be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to create a model to predict the percentage of semi-trucks that will be electric in the United States 5, 10, and 20 years from \n",
    "2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategy and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The winning teams approached the solution to this \n",
    "problem in completely different ways.  We will follow the \n",
    "strategy used by Team \\#13343, which is based on the use of \n",
    "Markov chains and estimating the probability of replacement \n",
    "of a diesel truck with an electric truck in any given year.  Broadly, \n",
    "the strategy consists of the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the population of semi-trucks into 3 groups: Short haul (SH), \n",
    "regional haul (RH), and long haul (LH), depending on a truck's \n",
    "typical range of operations.  This makes sense because truck models \n",
    "and their prices vary significantly based on the operating range \n",
    "for which they are designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each group, the unknown quantity of interest will be \n",
    "taken to be the proportion of electric trucks in the fleet at any \n",
    "given time.  We want our model to estimate (or predict) this quantity \n",
    "for future years.  In Markov chain terminology, our unknown is \n",
    "represented by a *state vector* consisting of two \n",
    "components: the proportion of electric trucks, and its complement \n",
    "(i.e., the proportion of diesel trucks).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each group of trucks, we will construct a $2\\times 2$ transition \n",
    "matrix that represents the probability of conversion from \n",
    "one state (diesel) to the other (electric).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Future states are predicted by multiplying the transition \n",
    "matrix with the current value of the state vector.  For instance, \n",
    "if $T$ is the transition matrix and $s_k$  is the state vector for \n",
    "year $k$, then for year $k+1$ we compute: $s_{k+1} = T s_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Markov chain methods, the transition matrix plays a critical \n",
    "role in shaping the model's outcomes.  Constructing this \n",
    "matrix carefully and reliably is a central goal of the modeling \n",
    "effort.  In our problem, the 4 terms in this matrix represent the \n",
    "probability of the 4 possible conversions happening in the \n",
    "course of a given year: diesel to diesel ($p_{dd}$), \n",
    "diesel to electric ($p_{de}$), electric to diesel ($p_{ed}$), \n",
    "electric to electric ($p_{ee}$).  The \n",
    "sketch below illustrates the situation and will help in \n",
    "constructing the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\n",
    "<IMG SRC=\"./state_diagram.png\"></IMG>\n",
    "</DIV>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $p_{dd}+p_{de}$ must equal 1, and likewise for \n",
    "$p_{ee}+p_{ed}$.  Estimating the values of these 4 probabilities \n",
    "comprises the centerpiece of the modeling effort, and we will \n",
    "do it separately for each of the 3 truck groups.  The value of $p_{de}$ \n",
    "(the probability a diesel truck is replaced by electric) is \n",
    "particularly important, and Team 13343 hypothesized it is \n",
    "proportional to the **cost difference** between the two types of \n",
    "trucks.  In fact, here are the key assumptions they made, which are \n",
    "nicely summarized in their paper\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The total cost difference (buying+operating) between a diesel \n",
    " and electric truck is proportional to the probability of a \n",
    " diesel truck being replaced by an electric one.\n",
    " 2. Both types of trucks have approximately the same life expectancy \n",
    " (around 12 years), after which they become inoperable.\n",
    " 3. Each semi-truck is replaced when it becomes inoperable.\n",
    " 5. About 1% of electric trucks will be replaced by diesel trucks.\n",
    " 3. The market demand for new semi-trucks requires manufacturing \n",
    " at least 210,466 total trucks per year.\n",
    " 4. There are/were no electric semi-trucks in operation in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of these assumptions may be hard to justify in a rigorous \n",
    "way (e.g., 2 and 4), they offer a reasonable starting point for \n",
    "a process of iterative model development.  Thus, we will use them \n",
    "to build a first model.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### 3. The model and its variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will consist of a $2\\times 2$ transition matrix, \n",
    "together with an initial value of the state vector, for each of \n",
    "the 3 truck groups: SH, RH, and LH.  The form of the matrix is \n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbf{T} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    p_{dd}  &  p_{ed} \\\\\n",
    "    p_{de}  &  p_{ee}\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The entries in the matrix correspond to the probabilities shown \n",
    "in the state diagram earlier.  From the assumptions listed \n",
    "previously, it follows that \n",
    "$p_{ed} = 0.01$ and $p_{ee}=0.99$.  Thus, what remains to be found \n",
    "is $p_{de}$, the probability of a diesel truck being replaced by an \n",
    "electric truck.  Once we find this, we get $p_{dd}=1-p_{de}$.  A major \n",
    "part of the modeling \n",
    "effort for this problem is based on finding and synthesizing \n",
    "relevant data.  The key \n",
    "information we need includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typical cost of buying a new diesel semi (separate for short haul and long haul).\n",
    "- Typical cost of buying a new electric semi.\n",
    "- Lifetime operating cost for each type of truck, on each type of \n",
    "route.  \n",
    "Typically: `(cost per mile)` $\\times$ `(number of miles per year)` $\\times$ `(years in lifetime)`\n",
    "- Number of semis that operate on each of the 3 types of routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the needed data is available in the form of average \n",
    "quantities from the references and spreadsheets provided by the \n",
    "contest (see the links given above).  For instance, the average \n",
    "number of miles driven per year given in the \"Truck Usage Data\" \n",
    "reference is: 42,640 (SH), 70,000 (RH), and 118,820 (LH).  Team 13343 \n",
    "estimated the average cost per mile to be $\\$1.51$ and $\\$1.26$ \n",
    "for diesel and electric trucks, respectively.  They compiled \n",
    "the following table to summarize all the essential data\n",
