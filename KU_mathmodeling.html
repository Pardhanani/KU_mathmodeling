<h1 id="Mathematical-modeling-labs">Mathematical modeling labs<a class="anchor-link" href="#Mathematical-modeling-labs"></a></h1><p>These Python notebooks are self-guided lab modules designed to 
introduce mathematical modeling techniques in the context of 
a variety of real-world application areas.  The focus is 
primarily on a hands on treatment of the application, although 
a brief exposition of the associated mathematics is included 
where needed.  The mathematical background expected is that of 
a typical undergraduate student in a STEM discipline.</p>
<p>Each module 
implements the modeling technique in the form of Python code 
segments that are integrated into the notebook.  Although no 
previous coding experience is necessary, we encourage students 
to run the code and explore the effect of making changes to 
various modeling parameters.  In order to do this, the student 
will need to launch the notebook in "Interactive" mode, which is 
an option provided for each lab below.</p>

<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
The northern spotted owl in the United States is a threatened 
species that faces risk of extinction.  In this module, a difference 
equation system is used to study the owl's population trends.

<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
Water canals in the city of Bangkok play a variety of functional 
roles, including drainage of flood waters.  In this lab we 
consider a simple canal network, and determine the best pumping and 
draining strategy during peak flooding events. </FONT>

<p>The next set of lab modules is based on the 
<a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/the-challenge/" TARGET="_blank">MathWoks Math Modeling Challenge</a> 
contest (also known as M3C) for high school students.  Each 
lab focuses on  a problem that 
appeared in one of the contests, and presents a guided solution 
strategy based on the winning papers.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><p><strong>Predicting the growth in sales and usage of electric bikes</strong> <BR></BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
The sales and usage of e-bikes, or electric 2-wheelers has been 
rapidly increasing in many countries.  This module focuses on 
building a logistic growth model for forecasting future sales 
of e-bikes in the United States.

<li><p><strong>Modeling the addiction to e-cigarettes and vaping</strong> <BR></BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
The increasing use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers, particularly 
among younger people, has been a cause of growing concern for 
public health organizations.  In this lab we build a differential 
equations model to predict the spread of nicotine use as a result 
of vaping.

<li><p><strong>Electrification of the freight trucking industry</strong> <BR></BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
Large freight trucks comprise the backbone of cargo transportation 
in many countries, and they carry nearly everything that we buy, 
build or consume.  As a result, there is much interest in 
non-fossil fuel alternatives such as electric trucks.  In this 
lab we build Markov chain models to predict the rate of adoption of 
electric trucks in the U.S.

<li><p><strong>The problem of world hunger and food waste</strong> <BR></BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000B6">
We live in a paradoxical world wherein unmet hunger and 
food shortages coexist with the problem of enormous amounts of 
food being thrown out or wasted every day.  This module focuses on 
determining whether the amount of wasted food in a state (in the 
U.S.) is sufficient to feed all the food insecure people in that state.
