    "significance.  The inlet and exit nodes are numbered 1 and 11, \n",
    "respectively.  This implies the overall flow pattern through \n",
    "the network is from left to right.  \n",
    "For simplicity, we assume each canal is  frictionless, \n",
    "with uniform shape and capacity.  The sketch shows the peak \n",
    "capacity of each canal in parentheses, and we assume the \n",
    "corresponding numerical values are unitless.  Each canal is \n",

    "In the event of a flood, this network must serve as a \n",
    "drainage mechanism to discharge flood waters into the sea \n",
    "as quickly as possible.  To accomplish this, we must \n",
    "maximize the overall rate at which water flows through the network.  \n",
    "But how?  Consider the following \"thought experiments\" (as one \n",
    "of my professors used to call them):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose water is flowing into the inlet node at the maximum \n",
    "capacity of the entry channel (node 1 to 2).  How will the flow \n",
    "split at node 2?  How much flows to node 3?  And to node 4?  Recall, \n",
    "we have pumps and can split the flow any way we want.\n",
    "* Is it actually possible for the entry channel to admit \n",
    "water flow upto its maximum capacity of 35 units?  Why?\n",
    "* Suppose 20 units of water is flowing in through node 1.  How much is flowing out through node 11?  Why?\n",
    "* Suppose 20 units of water is flowing into node 6.  What \n",
    "is the sum of the flow out of node 6?\n",
    "\n",
    "These thought experiments suggest that the overall discharge \n",
    "through the network will be maximized when each canal discharges \n",
    "water at some optimal rate, which we must determine.  Since there \n",
    "are 12 canals in the network, there are 12 unknown discharge \n",
    "rates to be determined.  This can be accomplished by posing it \n",
    "as an optimization problem in which a linear function is \n",
    "to be maximized, subject to a set of linear constraints.\n",

    "[for example, $f(3,5)=10$ and $f(6,8)=12.5$].  <BR></BR>\n",
    "Then, one set of constraints is simply the conditions of continuity \n",
    "at each node:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "  f(1,2) & = & f(2,3) + f(2,4)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(2,3) & = & f(3,5)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(2,4) & = & f(4,6)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(3,5) & = & f(5,7)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(4,6) & = & f(6,7) + f(6,8) \\\\\n",
    "  f(5,7) + f(6,7) & = & f(7,9)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(6,8) & = & f(8,10)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(7,9) & = & f(9,11)  \\\\\n",
    "  f(8,10) & = & f(10,11)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the peak capacity of each canal imposes another \n",
    "set of constraints:\n",
    "$f(1,2) \\le 35, ~ f(2,3) \\le 20, \\ldots$, etc.  <BR></BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, there is also the constraint of non-negativity \n",
    "that must be satisfied: $f(x,y) \\ge 0$ for all valid $(x,y)$ pairs.  \n",
    "But it is common practice for optimization software to \n",
    "permit the enforcement of non-negativity constraints when defining \n",
    "the unknown variables.  <BR></BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the quantity we want to maximize is the overall flow \n",
    "rate, which is simply the value of $f(1,2)$.  <BR></BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the optimization problem can be stated as: <P></P>\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; \n",
    "maximize $f(1,2)$  <BR></BR>\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; \n",
